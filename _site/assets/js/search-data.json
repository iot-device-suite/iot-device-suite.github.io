To activate it, all you have to do is to follow the simple steps listed in the MFA activation page. ### Change password Changing your password regularly reduces your risk of exposure and avoids a number of dangers. That's wahy we supported the Change Password in our GUI. ### Session Timeout This is another security mechanism we support in our GUI: Session Timeout! Your login session is valid for only 30 min, after this you will get logged out automatically. ",

Popular applications are household appliances, cars or agricultural machinery in which computers are installed. The development into the Internet of Things (IoT) and the resulting new connectivity with the Internet and data clouds resulted in numerous advantages. But there was also a risk that Internet-enabled devices would become vulnerable to cyberattacks. The IoT Device Manager from The Embedded Security Experts allows us to provide you with an IoT security solution to manage and secure IoT devices from data manipulation, device decommissioning, product piracy, data theft and the misuse of IoT systems due to the development of an unwanted botnet. Since no set-up is like any other, we develop customised IoT security solutions for you that are tailored to your needs. Contact us to secure your IoT devices.
