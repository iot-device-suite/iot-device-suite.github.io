<p>Classically embedded systems have long been considered particularly secure, as they were not connected to the Internet, and they were not yet producing the data that makes novel business models possible today. Popular applications are household appliances, cars or agricultural machinery in which computers are installed. The development into the Internet of Things (IoT) and the resulting new connectivity with the Internet and data clouds resulted in numerous advantages. But there was also a risk that Internet-enabled devices would become vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p>

<p>The IoT Device Manager from The Embedded Security Experts allows us to provide you with an IoT security solution to manage and secure IoT devices from data manipulation, device decommissioning, product piracy, data theft and the misuse of IoT systems due to the development of an unwanted botnet.</p>

<p>Since no set-up is like any other, we develop customised IoT security solutions for you that are tailored to your needs. Contact us to secure your IoT devices.</p>
