## Account Security Features

### Multi Factor Authentication
In our GUI, we make sure that your account is always secure, that's why we supported a Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP) as a second authentication mechanism.<br/>
To activate it, all you have to do is to follow the simple steps listed in the MFA activation page.

### Change password
Changing your password regularly reduces your risk of exposure and avoids a number of dangers. That's wahy we supported the <strong>Change Password</strong> in our GUI.

### Session Timeout
This is another security mechanism we support in our GUI: Session Timeout! <br/>
Your login session is valid for only 30 min, after this you will get logged out automatically.
